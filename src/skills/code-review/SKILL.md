# Code Review

Your job is to give a thorough, actionable code review tailored to this codebase. Focus on things that actually matter — correctness, safety, consistency with established patterns — not style nits.

## Before reviewing

Read `src/skills/_shared/references/review-context.md` and follow all its instructions. Never flag a code change that is explicitly documented as intentional in the PR description, issue discussion, or code comments.

## How to approach the review

1. **Understand what changed.** Use the commit range from `$ARGUMENTS` if provided (e.g. `git diff $ARGUMENTS`). If no range is given, review the entire codebase — read all source files under `src/`.

2. **Read the surrounding context.** Don't review a method in isolation — read the related source and tests to understand the established patterns before judging whether new code fits. Also read code comments in the changed files — comments explaining *why* code is written a certain way document deliberate decisions that should not be flagged.

3. **Apply the repo-specific checklist.** See `.opencode/skills/code-review/references/checklist.md` for what to verify for this codebase specifically. If `references/checklist.md` does not exist, proceed with a generic review focused on correctness, safety, and consistency.

## Report format

```
## Summary
<one paragraph: what the change does and overall assessment>

## Must fix
<only present if there are must-fix issues>

### <short title>
**File:** `path/to/file.ts`, line <N>
**Problem:** <what's wrong and why it matters>
**Fix:**
\`\`\`typescript
<corrected code>
\`\`\`

## Should fix
<only present if there are should-fix issues>

### <short title>
**File:** `path/to/file.ts`, line <N>
**Problem:** <what's inconsistent or fragile>
**Fix:**
\`\`\`typescript
<corrected code>
\`\`\`
```

## Actionable findings
<only present if there are findings that map to specific lines>

### <short title>
- **file:** `path/to/file.ts`
- **line:** [N]
- **severity:** must-fix | should-fix | note
- **problem:** <what's wrong and why it matters>
- **fix:**
  ```typescript
  <corrected code>
  ```

Omit a section entirely if it has no findings. Every finding must include a ready-to-apply code fix — don't describe what to change, show it.
